# Lab 13 - Implement a cipher

lab13.py - Contains code to run the cipher

example.py - An example of a cipher. Please look at this file if you would like to know what needs to be done.

cipher.py - This is where you should implement your cipher


## Getting Started

1. Run the program with the example cipher to see how it works:

    `python lab13.py`

2. Implement your cipher in cipher.py, filling in all the TODOs

3. Update lab13.py so it runs your cipher.
